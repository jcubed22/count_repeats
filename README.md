# _Repeat Counter_

##### _Counts how many times a word shows up in a string of text, 8/14/2015_

#### By _**Jordan Johansen**_

## Description

_This application displays a page containing a form with two input fields: one for a string of text, and one for a "keyword."  When the user submits the form, the application returns another page that displays how many times the keyword appears in the string, ignoring partial matches (e.g. the keyword "house" would appear in the string "household" 0 times).  The application is not case-sensitive._

## Setup

* _Run composer install from Terminal in the project root folder._
* _Start a PHP server in the /web folder._

_This application is missing the vendor folder containing the required Twig and Silex files.  Running composer install is crucial.  As is the PHP server.  Doi._

## Technologies Used

_PHPUnit for testing, PHP, Silex, Twig._
